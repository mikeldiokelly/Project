The Cotton Bowl, the game, is Friday at the JerryDome. Bowl season: where common sense goes to die. In any case, it’s your last chance to see Case Keenum — owner of many NCAA passing records and averaging nearly 400 passing yards this season — in a Houston uniform, though his previous bowl forays have been a bit disastrous: In three bowl games, Keenum has three touchdown passes and seven interceptions, six of them coming in the 2009 Armed Forces Bowl against Air Force. Penn State has the nation’s fifth-ranked passing defense (162.2 yards allowed per game) and has allowed only nine passing touchdowns this season, fourth in the nation.\", \"subtype\": \"paragraph\", \"type\": \"sanitized_html\", \"mime\": \"text/plain\"}, {\"content\": \"1 p.m.\", \"subtype\": \"sublabel\", \"type\": \"sanitized_html\", \"mime\": \"text/plain\"}, {\"content\": \"Gator Bowl\", \"subtype\": \"subhead\", \"type\": \"sanitized_html\", \"mime\": \"text/plain\"}, {\"content\": \"<b>Who:</b> <a href=\\\"http://stats.washingtonpost.com/cfb/teamstats.asp?team=0033&report=teamhome\\\">Ohio State v</a>s. <a href=\\\"http://stats.washingtonpost.com/cfb/teamstats.asp?team=0067&report=teamhome\\\">Florida.</a>\", \"subtype\": \"paragraph\", \"type\": \"sanitized_html\", \"mime\": \"text/html\"}, {\"content\": \"<b>Where:</b> EverBank Field, <br />Jacksonville, Fla.\", \"subtype\": \"paragraph\", \"type\": \"sanitized_html\", \"mime\": \"text/html\"}, {\"content\": \"<b>TV:</b> ESPN2.\", \"subtype\": \"paragraph\", \"type\": \"sanitized_html\", \"mime\": \"text/html\"}, {\"content\": \"<b>Records:</b> Buckeyes 6-6; Gators 6-6.\", \"subtype\": \"paragraph\", \"type\": \"sanitized_html\", \"mime\": \"text/html\"}, {\"content\": \"The Buckeyes, soon to be coached by Urban Meyer, take on the Gators, formerly coached by Urban Meyer.
